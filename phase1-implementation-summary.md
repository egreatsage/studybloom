# Phase 1 Implementation Summary - Timetable Module

## Completed Tasks

### 1. Database Models Created

#### Core Models:
- **Timetable** (`src/models/Timetable.js`)
  - Links semesters and courses
  - Manages draft/published/archived states
  - Tracks effective dates and metadata

- **Lecture** (`src/models/Lecture.js`)
  - Defines recurring class sessions
  - Includes time, venue, teacher, and unit information
  - Supports different lecture types (lecture, tutorial, lab, seminar)
  - Has conflict detection methods

- **LectureInstance** (`src/models/LectureInstance.js`)
  - Tracks individual class occurrences
  - Manages attendance records
  - Handles cancellations and postponements
  - Stores lecture materials

- **Venue** (`src/models/Venue.js`)
  - Manages classroom/lab resources
  - Tracks capacity and facilities
  - Includes maintenance scheduling
  - Has availability checking methods

#### Updated Models:
- **TeachingAssignment** - Enhanced to include:
  - Semester-specific assignments
  - Unit-level teacher assignments
  - Active/inactive status for units

### 2. API Endpoints Implemented

#### Timetable Management:
- `GET /api/timetables` - List all timetables with filters
- `POST /api/timetables` - Create new timetable (admin only)
- `PUT /api/timetables?id={id}` - Update timetable (admin only)
- `DELETE /api/timetables?id={id}` - Delete timetable (admin only)
- `POST /api/timetables/{id}/publish` - Publish timetable (admin only)

#### Lecture Management:
- `GET /api/lectures` - List lectures with filters
- `POST /api/lectures` - Create lecture slot (admin only)
- `PUT /api/lectures?id={id}` - Update lecture (admin only)
- `DELETE /api/lectures?id={id}` - Delete lecture (admin only)
- `POST /api/lectures/bulk` - Bulk create lectures (admin only)

#### Venue Management:
- `GET /api/venues` - List all venues
- `POST /api/venues` - Create venue (admin only)
- `PUT /api/venues?id={id}` - Update venue (admin only)
- `DELETE /api/venues?id={id}` - Delete venue (admin only)
- `GET /api/venues/availability` - Check venue availability

#### Schedule Access:
- `GET /api/teachers/schedule` - Get teacher's schedule
- `GET /api/students/schedule` - Get student's schedule based on registered units

### 3. Key Features Implemented

#### Authorization & Security:
- Role-based access control (admin, teacher, student)
- Session-based authentication checks
- Data validation and sanitization

#### Conflict Detection:
- Teacher double-booking prevention
- Venue availability checking
- Student schedule conflict detection
- Time overlap validation

#### Data Relationships:
- Proper MongoDB references with population
- Compound indexes for performance
- Virtual fields for computed properties

#### Business Logic:
- Timetable status management (draft → published → archived)
- Only one active timetable per semester/course
- Lecture instances generation from recurring lectures
- Attendance tracking per instance

### 4. Technical Highlights

#### Performance Optimizations:
- Indexed queries for efficient lookups
- Selective field population
- Compound indexes on frequently queried fields

#### Error Handling:
- Comprehensive validation
- Meaningful error messages
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Try-catch blocks for all endpoints

#### Data Integrity:
- Unique constraints where needed
- Foreign key validation
- Status transition rules
- Deletion protection for referenced data

## Next Steps (Phase 2-4)

### Phase 2: Admin Interface
- Timetable creation UI
- Drag-and-drop lecture scheduler
- Venue management interface
- Conflict visualization

### Phase 3: Teacher and Student Views
- Weekly/monthly calendar views
- Personal dashboards
- Mobile-responsive design
- Export functionality

### Phase 4: Advanced Features
- Attendance tracking UI
- Notification system
- Calendar sync
- Analytics and reports

## Testing Recommendations

### API Testing:
1. Test all CRUD operations for each model
2. Verify authorization for each endpoint
3. Test conflict detection scenarios
4. Validate data integrity constraints

### Integration Testing:
1. Test timetable publishing workflow
2. Verify schedule generation for students
3. Test venue booking conflicts
4. Validate attendance tracking

### Performance Testing:
1. Test with large datasets
2. Verify index effectiveness
3. Test concurrent operations
4. Monitor query performance

## Usage Examples

### Creating a Timetable:
```javascript
POST /api/timetables
{
  "semester": "semesterId",
  "course": "courseId",
  "effectiveFrom": "2024-01-01",
  "effectiveTo": "2024-05-31",
  "metadata": {
    "totalWeeks": 16,
    "hoursPerWeek": 40
  }
}
```

### Adding a Lecture:
```javascript
POST /api/lectures
{
  "timetable": "timetableId",
  "unit": "unitId",
  "teacher": "teacherId",
  "dayOfWeek": 1,
  "startTime": "09:00",
  "endTime": "11:00",
  "venue": {
    "building": "Science Block",
    "room": "Lab 101",
    "capacity": 30
  },
  "lectureType": "lab",
  "color": "#10B981"
}
```

### Checking Student Schedule:
```javascript
GET /api/students/schedule?semesterId=xxx&startDate=2024-01-01&endDate=2024-01-31
```

## Notes

- All models include proper Mongoose schema validation
- APIs follow RESTful conventions
- Error handling is consistent across all endpoints
- The system is designed to scale with proper indexing
- Future phases will build upon this solid foundation
